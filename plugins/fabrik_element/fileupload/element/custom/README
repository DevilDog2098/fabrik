You can add custom filetypes, or override the default handling of filetypes by creating files here.  For instance,
to modify the way you display mp3's, you would copy the mp3.php from the folder above, and change it to return your
custom renderer class that implements the Fabrik\Plugin\FabrikElement\Fileupload\Renderer\RendererInterface.
